## What is Federated Learning
Federated learning (FL for short) is a collaborative machine learning approach that enables multiple participants (clients) to train a 
shared model while keeping their data decentralized. Instead of uploading their data to a central server, clients only share model updates, which helps in preserving data privacy and security.

## PyFLOptimizer
`PyFLOptimizer` is a Python package designed to enhance federated learning through game-theoretic approaches. It offers a suite of tools and algorithms to optimize federated learning processes, ensuring efficient and robust model training across multiple clients.

## Features
- **Game-Theoretic Optimization**: Utilizes game theory to improve the selection of the convenient clients in order to get the best possible model.
  The key concept behind this optimizer is the use of the Shapley value:
  - **Shapley Value**: The Shapley value is a solution concept in cooperative game theory. It provides a fair distribution of the total gains (or costs) to the players, assuming that they all collaborate. In the context of federated learning, the Shapley value is used to fairly allocate the contribution of each client to the overall model performance. This helps in identifying and selecting the most valuable clients for model updates.

    The Shapley value for a client \(i\) is calculated as:
    $\[
    \phi_i = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|! (|N| - |S| - 1)!}{|N|!} \left( v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S) \right)
    \]$
    where:
    - \(N\) is the set of all clients.
    - \(S\) is a subset of clients not including client \(i\).
    - \(v(S)\) is the value (e.g., model performance) obtained by the subset \(S\).

  - **Fair Contribution**: By evaluating the marginal contributions of each client, the optimizer ensures that each client's impact on the global model is accurately measured and rewarded.
  
    The marginal contribution of a client \(i\) to a subset \(S\) is:
    $\[
    v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S)
    \]$

  - **Client Selection**: The optimizer strategically selects clients based on their Shapley values, ensuring that the most informative and valuable data contributions are prioritized. This leads to more efficient and effective model training.
  
    Clients are selected based on their Shapley values, with higher values indicating greater importance and contribution to the model.

  - **Enhanced Performance**: By leveraging the Shapley value, the optimizer can improve the overall performance of the federated learning model, leading to faster convergence and better accuracy.

These features make `PyFLOptimizer` a powerful tool for enhancing federated learning through fair and effective client selection based on game-theoretic principles.
